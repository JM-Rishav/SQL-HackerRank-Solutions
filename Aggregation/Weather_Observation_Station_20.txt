# Weather Observation Station 20

/*
Median of the LAT_N from station.
Round to 4 decimal places.
*/

select round(LAT_N,4) 
from station 
order by lat_n limit 1 offset 249 ;

explanation:- Offset keyword helps us to skip the give number of records. Example in the query:- select round(LAT_N,4) from station order by lat_n limit 1 offset 249 ;

offset is set to 249 so it will skip the first 249 records.

(or)

SET @r = 0;
SELECT ROUND(AVG(Lat_N), 4)
FROM (SELECT (@r := @r + 1) AS r, Lat_N FROM Station ORDER BY Lat_N) Temp
WHERE
    r = (SELECT CEIL(COUNT(*) / 2) FROM Station) OR
    r = (SELECT FLOOR((COUNT(*) / 2) + 1) FROM Station)


Explanation:- Consider these 2 cases:
- In a table with an even row count, the average of the 2 "middle rows" is the median
- In a table with an uneven row count however, only 1 "middle row" will be the median

Example case #1 (table with 200 rows):
r = (SELECT CEIL(COUNT(*) / 2) FROM Station) will equal 100
r = (SELECT FLOOR((COUNT(*) / 2) + 1) FROM Station) will equal 101

Example case #2 (table with 201 rows):
r = (SELECT CEIL(COUNT(*) / 2) FROM Station) will equal 101
r = (SELECT FLOOR((COUNT(*) / 2) + 1) FROM Station) will also equal 101
