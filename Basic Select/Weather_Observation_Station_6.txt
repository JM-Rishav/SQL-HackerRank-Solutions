# Weather Observation Station 6

# Enter your code here.
/*
List of city name starting with vowels.
*/
SELECT DISTINCT(CITY)
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP "^[aeiou].*"

/*
'.'
means match any character, thus,

'.*'
means match any sequence of character Some more details here:


s* means begins with s later can be any characters (.*)
*s means ends with s (*.)

I believe your regex would have to be modified to be "*.[aeiou]$" if you want to test for ending with a vowel.
